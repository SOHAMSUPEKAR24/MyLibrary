# MyLibrary
This repository is a guide to creating and managing custom libraries across multiple programming languages, focusing on modular, reusable code. You'll find examples for building libraries in Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more, with language-specific steps for setup, testing, and deployment.
# Features
Language-Specific Libraries: Step-by-step guides to create libraries in popular languages, each with tailored examples and use cases.

Python: Building Python packages with setuptools, creating virtual environments, publishing on PyPI, and versioning.
JavaScript: Developing Node.js modules, bundling with Webpack, and publishing on npm.
Java: Creating reusable Java packages with Maven or Gradle, handling dependencies, and deploying to Maven Central.
C++: Writing header and implementation files, managing dependencies with CMake, and packaging.
C#: Developing .NET libraries, creating NuGet packages, and deploying to NuGet.org.
Rust: Building reusable modules, managing dependencies with Cargo, and publishing on crates.io.
Cross-Language Best Practices: Insights into modular design, naming conventions, documentation standards, and testing strategies for libraries across languages.

Testing & Documentation: Examples of setting up automated testing frameworks, as well as creating documentation with tools like Sphinx, JSDoc, and Doxygen.

Versioning & Deployment: Techniques for semantic versioning, handling dependencies, and deploying libraries to language-specific repositories.

Getting Started
Explore each language folder for detailed instructions and code samples, or follow the root-level README for a general overview. This repository is a useful resource for developers looking to structure and manage their custom libraries effectively, from local projects to public distributions.
